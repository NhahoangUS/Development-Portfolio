# Development Portfolio
 - My role in this project is Unreal Engine programmer.
 - In the development process, I have faced 2 main challenges.
    - The very first challenge is Unreal Engine is new to me. So, it took me a lot of time to get used to the engine.
    - The second challenge is I am not the only one on my team who is new to Unreal Engine; Therefore, the way we solve the same problem is different. So, it took a lot of time to glue the parts together.
 - How I overcame those challenges:
    - For the first challenge, to work on a project in the short term, it is not practical to learn new things from books; Therefore, I have searched on Google and youtube for tutorials for many specific problems. The good thing about this way is I can quickly solve the problem for my game. However, the downside is my knowledge is not solid and seamless.
    - For the second challenge, this is the consequence of the first challenge since the whole team learned from the internet; Therefore, the blueprints we made were not straightforward in design, so in many cases, we had to change the blueprint's design of other teammates, then causes bugs. To solve this challenge, I checked all the blueprints and try to understand the design for a few hours before asking my teammate to explain their design.
 - Lessons learned: for the students who will study this course, before beginning to work on the project, the whole team should sit down and work together on the game's design. The design should begin from the splash screen and menus, instead of making the game from the gameplay. I have learned that working on a team for a game project is not easy. However, this is a great chance for me to know about the difficulty of game-making and draw an initial picture for my job. 
 - For this project, my team has used github.com as the version control tool. The experience is very good. We were able to save all the process. In some cases, we can revert the last commit to save the process.
 - The images below are the main frame design of my team and the designs that I have done.
