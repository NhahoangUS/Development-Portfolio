# Development-Portfolio
 - My role in the project is Unreal Engine programmer. In detail, I don't have the specific area to focus. I will do any task that needed for the game.
 - The challenges you faced
 - How you overcame those challenges, including specific APIs used and code fragments (both Blueprints and C++)
An architectural diagram(s) that roughly portrays the architecture of your final project and then shows the design of your specific parts in more detail. This might include UML, control flow diagram, networking diagrams etc.
 - Lessons learned: how should students facing similar challenges in the future tackle the problems you faced?
 - Describe your version control choice, and your experience with it.

The goal is to convey what you personally were able to accomplish and learn in the project, and to help future students who might face similar challenges. Additionally, it should be an opportunity to showcase your work to potential employers. With that in mind, please keep the tone professional and take the opportunity to highlight unique skills you might have picked up while developing the project and your ability to solve complex problems.
